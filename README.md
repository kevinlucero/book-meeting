This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### run `npm install` to get all the dependency

run the program using `npm start`

run the test using `run test`

# when you delete all the default data, you can just delete 
# `state` from localStorage

### side notes ###

# I started program while our sprint is about to start too much meeting etc ..
# good luck to me!
